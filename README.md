## Project Description:
**Purpose:**  
A web application created to help organize numerous items that take a lot of time and energy to locate.
Specially for people like me who always forget where the items where put.
Instead of listing all items in `index.html`, only the “Type” of items is listed. When a “location” is selected, the list of all items at that location can be viewed.

### Features:

#### index.html
- **View**: View all items at the selected location
- **Add**: Function to add items
- **Edit**: Select and edit a specific item

#### add.html
- **Date (date)**
- **Location (radio)**
- **Item Type (select)**
- **Additional Notes (input text)**

### Validation Checks
- **Required**: Required fields check
- **Dropdown Selection**: Required fields check
- **Confirm**: Confirm before deletion
- **Alert**: Successful registration/edit alert

### Page Relationships:
- **Index - Main Page**:
  - View (View all items at the selected location)
    - Add (Function to add items)
    - Edit (Select and edit a specific item)

### Additional Features:
